# schwartze-backend
api and database for my [Schwartze-Ansingh project](https://www.lizzyansingh.nl).

The application will go live after I finished my research.
I have 500 letters from the families Schwartze and Ansingh, written between 1880 and 1940. I am currently reading them, which is time consuming. This application serves to enter the data on the letters, to show the scanned letters and transcripts. After finishing the preparations, I'll continue the research and write a book. When the book is finished, the application will go live. 

The backend software is at https://www.github.com/xtien/schwartze-backend
